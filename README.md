# TriviaGame

With this app I have created an Office trivia game! You can test your knowledge of America's favorite sitcom! You will be asked 10 questions which will be scored either when you answer all ten or you run out of time. 

The app is built with javascript/jquery, HTML and CSS. I have also implemented a music file to play The Office theme song during the game. If you have any questions comments or concerns about the app or just would like to get in touch, my portfolio is linked below!
